## Projects

Here's a short list of some of the things I've worked on in the past few years:

- Led the development of [**Rum 'n' Gun**](https://polimi-game-collective.itch.io/rum-n-gun) - a first person action platformer game - for the *Videogame Design and Programming* course at *Politecnico di Milano*.
  - You can watch a short gameplay trailer [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4xzPLKBvd8)!
  - The beta release, created in around three months, is available for Windows, Linux and Mac OS on [itch.io](https://polimi-game-collective.itch.io/rum-n-gun), try it out!

- [Vulture](https://github.com/giornetta/vulture) is a Vulkan Game Engine developed from scratch using C++. I built it with a friend during our Master's *Computer Graphics* course at *Politecnico di Milano*. Alongside the engine, we developed a small game to showcase its possibilities and features.

- [Traveller Bot](https://github.com/giornetta/travellerbot) is a Telegram bot which let's you play the classic Traveller RPG game with your Telegram friends. It was developed with two friends of mine as a project during our *Bachelor's degree* at *Politecnico di Milano*.
 
- [Watchazon](https://github.com/giornetta/watchazon) is a Telegram bot that can scrape Amazon and notify you when items you're interested in go on sale! I developed it as a personal project during my *high school* years.
