## Projects

- Currently leading the development of **Rum 'n' Gun** - a first person action game - for the *Videogame Design and Programming* course at *Politecnico di Milano*.

- **Vulture** is a Vulkan Game Engine developed from scratch using C++. I built it with a friend during our Master's *Computer Graphics* course at *Politecnico di Milano*. Alongside the engine, we developed a small game to showcase its possibilities and features.
