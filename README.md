# Hi, I'm Michele! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **MSc Computer Science & Engineering** Student at **Politecnico di Milano**.

I started programming in middle school, fascinated by video game development. Since then, I've explored many fields, becoming versatile and comfortable learning new languages, paradigms, and frameworks.

Iâ€™m currently studying best practices, patterns, and tools for microservice development with Cloud Native technologies, including event-driven architecture with Kafka and distributed tracing and monitoring with Jaeger and Prometheus, mostly using Go and C# as my primary programming languages.

Additionally, I'm expanding my skills in Game Development, focusing on Systems, AI, and Gameplay Programming using Unity and Unreal Engine 5.

## Projects

Here's a short list of some of the things I've worked on in the past few years:

- Led the development of [**Rum 'n' Gun**](https://polimi-game-collective.itch.io/rum-n-gun) - a first person action platformer game - for the *Videogame Design and Programming* course at *Politecnico di Milano*.
  - You can watch a short gameplay trailer [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4xzPLKBvd8)!
  - The beta release, created in around three months, is available for Windows, Linux and Mac OS on [itch.io](https://polimi-game-collective.itch.io/rum-n-gun), try it out!

- [Vulture](https://github.com/giornetta/vulture) is a Vulkan Game Engine developed from scratch using C++. I built it with a friend during our Master's *Computer Graphics* course at *Politecnico di Milano*. Alongside the engine, we developed a small game to showcase its possibilities and features.

- [Traveller Bot](https://github.com/giornetta/travellerbot) is a Telegram bot which let's you play the classic Traveller RPG game with your Telegram friends. It was developed with two friends of mine as a project during our *Bachelor's degree* at *Politecnico di Milano*.
 
- [Watchazon](https://github.com/giornetta/watchazon) is a Telegram bot that can scrape Amazon and notify you when items you're interested in go on sale! I developed it as a personal project during my *high school* years.

## Programming Languages

In my 10+ years of programming, I've played with *tons* of different languages, but these are the ones I've enjoyed the most lately:

![Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/go-%2300ADD8.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=go&logoColor=white)
![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/c%23-%23239120.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=csharp&logoColor=white)
![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-007ACC?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)
![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=openjdk&logoColor=white)
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)
![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/rust-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust&logoColor=white)

I'm working on deepening my **C++** knowledge, but it's a hard task and I'm no expert yet!

## Game Engines

I've used many Game Engines, but I haven't found one that ticks all the boxes yet. Until I decide I want to spend all my free time building my own, these are all great:

![Unity](https://img.shields.io/badge/unity-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=unity&logoColor=white)
![Bevy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bevy-232326?style=for-the-badge&logo=bevy&logoColor=white)
![LÃ–VE](https://img.shields.io/badge/L%C3%96VE-red?style=for-the-badge)
![Godot Engine](https://img.shields.io/badge/GODOT-%23FFFFFF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=godot-engine)

To get a better grasp of what's popular in the industry, I'm also learning **Unreal Engine 5**!

## Backend Technologies

Here are some of the tools and technologies I enjoy using when working on backend code:

![Apache Kafka](https://img.shields.io/badge/Apache_Kafka-231F20?style=for-the-badge&logo=apache-kafka&logoColor=white)
![Apache Spark](https://img.shields.io/badge/Apache_Spark-FFFFFF?style=for-the-badge&logo=apachespark&logoColor=#E35A16)
