## Projects

- Currently leading the development of **Rum 'n' Gun** - a first person action game - for the *Videogame Design and Programming* course at *Politecnico di Milano*.
 - The first prototype of the game is available on [itch.io](https://polimi-game-collective.itch.io/rum-n-gun).

- [Vulture](https://github.com/giornetta/vulture) is a Vulkan Game Engine developed from scratch using C++. I built it with a friend during our Master's *Computer Graphics* course at *Politecnico di Milano*. Alongside the engine, we developed a small game to showcase its possibilities and features.

- [Traveller Bot](https://github.com/giornetta/travellerbot) is a Telegram bot which let's you play the Traveller RPG game with your Telegram friends. It was developed with two friends of mine as a project during our *Bachelor's degree* at *Politecnico di Milano*
 
- [Watchazon](https://github.com/giornetta/watchazon) is a Telegram bot that can scrape Amazon and notify you when items you're interested in go on sale! I developed it as a personal project during my *high school* years.
